# Portfolio Prep

## Kao Saelor.  I build financial applications.

### About Me

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Kao Saelor, and I'm an aspiring software developer specializing in finance. I'm creating a portfolio website to showcase my skills and experience as a software developer, with a focus on financial applications. Through this website, I aim to demonstrate my technical capabilities, knowledge of financial systems, and ability to create powerful software solutions. Additionally, I hope to use this platform to connect with potential employers and collaborators to further my career goals.

I'm excited about tech because it allows us to connect with people from all over the world, access new resources, and make our lives easier. Technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and interact with each other. It has opened up a whole new world of possibilities, and I'm excited to explore what is to come.

### Projects I've Done

**Git Fit**

GitFit is a fitness website that helps people achieve their health and fitness goals by providing macro calculators, meal plans, and workout plans. It solves the problems of users not knowing how to calculate their macronutrients, how to create a nutritious meal plan, and how to design an effective workout plan.
